<title>Jenkins Git Client Plugin API Overview</title>
</head>
<body>

The Jenkins git client plugin provides an API to execute
general-purpose git operations on a local or remote repository. Its
primary use is from the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin" target="_blank">git-plugin</a>;
as such, it is also used by
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Plugin" target="_blank">gerrit-plugin</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Parameter+Plugin" target="_blank">git-parameter-plugin</a>,
workflow and cloudbees validated merge plugins.

<p>Plugin developers are encouraged to use
<a href="org/jenkinsci/plugins/gitclient/GitClient.html">GitClient API</a> in
replacement for the legacy IGitAPI.

<p>The plugin isolates this low-level git stuff from git-plugin, allowing
alternate git implementations
(like <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/JGit/User_Guide"  target="_blank">JGit</a>).</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, this plugin uses API classes from the
hudson.plugins.git package.</p>

<p>The git client plugin also bundles JGit and JGit http server so
that callers can rely on JGit and the JGit http server being available
without including it in their own plugin packaging. This is used to
reduce the size of the packaging of the git-server plugin, and may be
useful in other plugins.</p>
